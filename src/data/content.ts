export const questions = [
 ['Understanding astrology','How can astrology help me?','Astrology offers a traditional framework for reflecting on personality, timing, and life patterns. You can use it as one perspective when considering your next step.'],
 ['Understanding astrology','Are outcomes guaranteed?','No. Astrology is belief-based guidance, not a guarantee of future events. Your decisions and circumstances shape your life.'],
 ['Your consultation','Can I discuss love and relationship concerns?','Yes. Consultations can explore compatibility, communication, commitment, and relationship changes, while respecting the choices of everyone involved.'],
 ['Your consultation','Can I discuss spiritual concerns?','Yes. Spiritual readings and traditional cleansing practices offer a space for reflection. No consultation establishes that you are cursed or under a supernatural influence.'],
 ['Booking','How do I book a consultation?','Choose Book Appointment, add your preferences, and send your enquiry. Your appointment is confirmed only when AstroVision replies and agrees the details with you.'],
 ['Your consultation','What details should I prepare?','For a birth-chart reading, have your birth date, time, and place ready if you know them. Share personal details directly during your consultation rather than in a public review.'],
 ['Your consultation','What if I do not know my birth time?','Let us know. Some readings depend on an accurate time; we can explain the limitations and discuss other ways to approach your question.'],
 ['Privacy & expectations','How is my enquiry handled?','The website prepares your message in your browser. When you choose to send it using WhatsApp or Instagram, that service handles your message under its own privacy policy.'],
 ['Booking','Can I join from another country?','Online consultations can be arranged by phone or video. Include your time zone in your enquiry so a suitable time can be agreed.'],
 ['Website','Can I read the website in my language?','Use the website language selector for English, Greek, French, Dutch, Turkish, or Hindi. This changes the page text. Please confirm consultation language availability directly with AstroVision.'],
 ['Booking','How long is a session?','The length depends on the reading and what you would like to discuss. Ask when arranging your appointment so you know what to expect.'],
 ['Privacy & expectations','Do I have to follow a remedy or continue a session?','No. Traditional practices are optional. You are free to ask questions, decline a suggestion, or stop the conversation.'],
 ['Privacy & expectations','Does this replace professional advice?','No. Spiritual guidance does not replace medical, psychological, legal, or financial advice. Seek support from a qualified professional for those needs.'],
 ['Booking','Can I change my appointment?','Contact AstroVision through the same conversation used to arrange your appointment. A new time is subject to availability.'],
